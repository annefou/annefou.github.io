description: Climate change poses risks to European communities, requiring robust adaptation strategies to protect ecosystems, economies and public health. However, fragmented data and limited interoperability across regions hinder coordinated action. Often, valuable insights remain inaccessible to policymakers and researchers seeking evidence-based solutions. Addressing this data-sharing challenge is essential for creating flexible and responsive adaptation frameworks. In this context, the EU-funded FAIR2Adapt project is advancing climate resilience by transforming data into actionable knowledge. By collaborating with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), FAIR2Adapt builds a user-friendly, interoperable data-sharing platform using FAIR Digital Objects and tools like the I-ADOPT framework. Through case studies and stakeholder engagement, FAIR2Adapt develops customised, scalable solutions for climate adaptation.
