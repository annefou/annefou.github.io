description: JupyterGIS is a JupyterLab extension for collaborative GIS (Geographical Information System). It is designed to allow multiple people to work on the same geospatial project simultaneously, facilitating discussion and collaboration around map layers, spatial analyses, and other GIS data being developed. JupyterGIS provides basic support for QGIS project files, allowing users to import and export projects seamlessly between QGIS and JupyterLab. This compatibility preserves layer styles, data sources, and project settings, enabling smooth transitions between GIS work in QGIS and collaborative, cloud-based work in JupyterLab.
