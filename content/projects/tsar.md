### [TSAR](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/t-sar)

  - [T-SAR](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/t-sar) project: it aims at demonstrating that recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged in the automatic detection of FDIA in transport infrastructures. Prototypes have been developed by researchers (PhD student) and I am working on the operationalization of the code base.


#### Funding

TSAR is funded by the Research Council of Norway.
