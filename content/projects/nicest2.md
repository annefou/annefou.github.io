### [NICEST2](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/)

 [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/) project: I am the project leader of the second phase of the Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling. This project focuses on strengthening the Nordic position within climate modeling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives.


#### Main activities

- Enhance the performance and optimize and homogenize workflows used, so climate models (like EC-EARTH and NorESM) can be run in an efficient way on future computing resources (like EuroHPC).
- Widen the usage and expertise on evaluating Earth System Models and develop new diagnostic modules for the Nordic region within the ESMValTool.
- Create a roadmap for FAIRification of Nordic climate model data.

#### Funding

NICEST2 is funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)(https://neic.no) which facilitates development and operation of high-quality e-infrastructure solutions in areas of joint Nordic interest.
