[MAchine learning, Surface mass balance of glaciers, Snow cover, In-situ data, Volume change, Earth observation (MASSIVE) project](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/projects/massive/index.html). 

#### Main activities

The project team aims at improving glacier mapping and surface glacier mass balance estimation techniques with the help of machine learning, especially deep learning. We will develop the methodology for glaciers in Norway, Svalbard, the European Alps and the Himalayas and then expand it to regions with different glacier characteristics.

#### Funding

4 years project starting 1st September 2021 until 31 August 2025. 
This research project is funded by the “Forskerprosjekt for fornyelse-programme” of The Research Council of Norway.  The project number at NFR is 315971.
