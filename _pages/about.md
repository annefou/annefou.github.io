I am able to discuss and negotiate with scientists/analysts from different backgrounds in order to understand their needs and offer them the best 
solution and more importantly develop tools that are unanimously accepted.
I have been working in various environments ranging from operational with strong constrains (such as providing forecasts in a tight schedule, 
including correcting issues that may arise or road safety issues, or software development norms and related documentation) to research 
(where it is critical to provide users with a quick answer and develop ad-hoc tools fully meeting their requirements).

I am interested by Open Science and willing to learn about sustainable business models for Open Innovation.
