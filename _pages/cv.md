Education
======
* Master's Degree in Computer Science, Ecole normale supérieure, Lyon (France), 1993
* Diplôme d’Etudes Approfondies (ISCED 6) in Meteorology and atmospheric water cycle, University Blaise-Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand (France), 1994
* Ph.D in Atmospheric Physics, University Blaise-Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand (France), 1997

Work experience
======
* 2013-present: Research Software Engineer
  * Programming, visualizing and managing large data sets
  * Supporting researchers' and students' use of supercomputing resources
  * Compiling, optimizing and installing models and applications

* 2005-2013: Senior Analyst
  * Responsible of the Observational DataBase (ODB) software, a parallel database used at ECMWF, UK Metoffice, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Meteo-France, HIRLAM (HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model) and ALADIN communities (more than 16 countries).
  * Duties included: Architect, developer and User support
  
* 2001-2005: Research Engineer
  * Assist users to fully take advantage of IDRIS (Institut du Dévelopement et des Ressources en Informatique Scientifique) computing facilities (porting, optimisation and parallelisation of user codes); 
  * Participation to EU projects such as DEISA (Distributed European Infrastructure for Supercomputing Applications); 
  * Teaching (Fortran, MPI, complexity, theory of languages) both at IDRIS and University.

* 1999-2001: Researcher
  * Design of the architecture of the Intelligent Transport System in France; 
  * Development of a real time software to control (speed/direction) an automated vehicle prototype.

* 1998-1999: Research Engineer
  * Design and development of PALM (Projet d'Assimilation par Logiciel Multi-Méthodes) software (C/F90, MPI-2). PALM is a generalized coupler which ensures the correct link and synchronization of the software components of the data assimilation suite and which handles the algebra of the problem. 

* 1997-1998: Non-tenure staff in the Physics Department
  * Lectures in mathematics and fluid mechanics (master's level), 
  * research on assimilation of satellite data in a regional atmospheric meso-scale model.
