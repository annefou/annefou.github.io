With a simple command like squad_dataset = load_dataset(&quot;squad&quot;), get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),\nefficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV/JSON/text. With simple commands like tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_example), efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.\n\n"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first toolkit to support six Chinese NLP fundamental tasks. \n"
